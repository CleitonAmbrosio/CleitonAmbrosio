## About

I am currently working as a *Jr Data Scientist*, but I also hold a *MSc degree in Physics*. 

I have been studying Data Science since April/2021 and, thus, I have 1.5 years of professional experience in the area, in particular through the projects detailed below (besides the learnings in the work context). 

I am experient on developing all the stages of a business solution using the concepts and tools of Data Science, from understanding the business problem to deploying the final model to production.

Moreover, I believe Data Science to be more based on a good understanding of the business issue, on the nature of the available data and on the actionability of the results, than being just the application of a certain set of tools.

### :toolbox: Toolbox

- **Main tools:** Python, SQL, Git, DBT, k8s, Prefect, AWS, Power BI, Heroku
- **Databases:** Oracle, Snowflake
- **Other languages:** Matlab, Fortran, LaTeX

## Data Science Projects (5/2021 - Present)

### ["Insiders" Fidelity Program](https://github.com/CleitonAmbrosio/Insiders-Fidelity-Program) - _2nd cycle (improvement) under development_
  
Creation of a fidelity program for an online retail store through the segmentation of the customer base and identification of the most valuable users.<br>

Even though the whole project is not yet finished (fully in production), a complete 1st cycle has already been concluded, resulting in 5 cohesive and well-separated clusters, each of which accompanied by a suggested action to be taken by the business team.<br>
A 2nd cycle is currently in progress aiming on other feature engineering possibilities, besides other clustering algorithms.

### [Rossmann Stores Sales Forecast](https://github.com/CleitonAmbrosio/Rossmann-Store-Sales-Forecast)

Knowing in advance the income for the next few weeks can be decisive for managing a store towards a more accelerated growth. 

In this project, I developed a Machine Learning solution to predict the sales for each unit of a chain of stores for the next 6 weeks.  
   The final model generated daily forecasts with **at least 85% of accuracy** for **97.04%** of the stores. In the overall of the units, the **actual income of $289,571,750.00** for the 6 weeks was **predicted to be $286,722,368.00**, corresponding to a subestimation of only 0.98%.   
   The predictions per store were conveniently made available through a Telegram bot.
   
### [Miscellaneous Studies](https://github.com/CleitonAmbrosio/misc-studies)

Not actual Data Science projects, but more technical notebooks involving the exploration of a certain algorithm or method, to be kept as materials for further reference.

Up until now, it contains only some studies on different clustering scores to be used with centroid-based algorithms (in particular, KMeans), but the repo is intended to grow significantly in size over time.
