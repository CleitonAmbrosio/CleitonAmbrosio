## About

I am currently looking for opportunities as a *Data Scientist*, but I also hold a *MSc degree in Physics*. 

I have been studying Data Science since April/2021 and, thus, I have 5 months of professional experience in the area by working on the projects detailed below. Much of that is due to being part of a private Data Science Community with +400 members, which features the development of a variety of Data projects, study groups and discussion sessions with aspirants and professionals in the Data field. 

I feel confident about my abilities on developing all the stages of a business solution using the concepts and tools of Data Science, from understanding the business problem to deploying the final model to production.

Moreover, I believe Data Science to be more based on a good understanding of the business issue, on the nature of the available data and on the actionability of the results, than being just the application of a certain set of tools.

### :toolbox: Toolbox

- **Main tools:** Python, SQL, Git, Power BI, Heroku

## Data Science Projects

### "Insiders" Fidelity Program

Creation of a loyalty program for an online retail store through the segmentation of the customer base and identification of the most valuable users.

### [Rossmann Stores Sales Forecast]( https://github.com/CleitonAmbrosio/Rossmann-Store-Sales-Forecast )

Knowing in advance the income for the next few weeks can be decisive for managing a store towards a more accelerated growth. 

In this project, I developed a Machine Learning solution to predict the sales for each unit of a chain of stores for the next 6 weeks.  
   The final model generated daily forecasts with **at least 85% of accuracy** for **97.04%** of the stores. In the overall of the units, the **actual income of $289,571,750.00** for the 6 weeks was **predicted to be $286,722,368.00**, corresponding to a subestimation of only 0.98%.   
   The predictions per store were made available through a Telegram bot.
